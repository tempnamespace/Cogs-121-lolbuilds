We updated our frontend design to be more visually engaging and concisely organized. Although color scheme and some details are not yet refined, this iteration of the design should be a lot more captivating.
This design ensures that our functionality is easy to use and directly available to the users (as well as emphasized). For instance, we removed tab navigation which added unecessary load to user accessibility.
We plan to add more defining touch-ups such as unifying fonts, colors, sizes, and even logos in the near future.

Two actions:
a.) Look up a League of Legends summoner profile by in-game name and see the player's statistics and other gameplay history/information.

b.) Select the champion the player is about to play to see recommended Rune Paths, and if when player is in game, the application will suggest a build for the champion they are playing.

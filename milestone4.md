2.) Why new Iteration of UI: Our UI Skeleton is an improvement from the iteration in the previous milestone because we changed our technology stack and utilized the React framework. Our new UI design revolves around user input of a Summoner Name. This allows us to implement our goal function of offering specific build suggestion depending on a userâ€™s live game. The original design was based around a login system, which is not as accessible as the new design.

3.) Privacy: At no point do we plan to collect user data without their consent or share any collected data. Our application will be very upfront about what data we have access to (public info owned by Riot Games) and what data will be processed. In fact, our application interactions with user data minimally. There is currently no plan to save user information.

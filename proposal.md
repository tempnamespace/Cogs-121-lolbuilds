1. League of Legends player data analysis:
League of Legends is one of the most popular online video game across the world. Riot Games, the creator of League of Legends, encourages developers to utilize its comprehensive API to create tools for the player community. As avid gamers and fans of the game, we would love to dedicate our project to creating a “scouter” that analyzes an opponent’s match history and performance to suggest counter measures. We will use Riot’s APIs to get data regarding players and write algorithms to analyze the match data and highlight noteworthy information to prepare our user for the match up. Other popular services only offer information regarding players, but the user must parse through the data and look for worthy information themselves. Our application would eliminate this issue and offer users high level analysis directly.

2. League of Legends build suggestions:
Another idea we have regarding League of Legends using Riot Games’ API is build suggestions based on player’s current match. Item builds in the game require extensive knowledge. For a lot of new players, they simply memorize popular build paths without adaptability or much analysis. Our application will use Riot API and pull the current match information of our player. Based on the information of this match, we will use algorithms to suggest adaptive build based on the player’s situation. This will allow the player more room for play and help them build patterns of analysis as oppose to rigidly following build paths.

3. Tournament generator:
Similar to Challonge or Battlefy, where tournament bracket can be setup with a list of people and their rankings. We would like to optimize this for League of Legends, Overwatch, or any other games where we can grab player data through an API, and automatically create balanced teams.

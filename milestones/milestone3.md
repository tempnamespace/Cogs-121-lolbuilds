## Screenshots

Our screenshots differ from the prototype because there is no styling and we only mapped out the UI for two of the screens, which is "In-Game" and "Profile". The two pages we did map out are very similar to the prototype. We are still figuring out exactly how much information/data analyses we want to provide to users, so we may add more pages and features in the coming weeks. However, the core functionality is within the "In-Game" page.

We updated our frontend theme to be consistent with League of Legends' theme. The profile page, which includes the lookup, mimics the in-game lobby. We have updated to include the highest rank of the user. We have added an analyses page, where we visualize our data.

We currently have one data visualization, the role distribution for last 10 matches. This shows the roles the user has played in their last 10 matches. We plan to add more data visualizations. We separated the data visualization onto a new page because it utilizes past game data rather than in-game data.
